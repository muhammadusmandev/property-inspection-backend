    <div class="page-title">Inspection Standards of Practice & Scope of Service</div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="standards-of-practice-section-title">1. Introduction & Purpose</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I wrote this paper to show the standards for the home inspection. The inspection is a non-invasive look 
            at the systems and parts that are easy to reach in the residential property. The inspection takes place 
            on the date of the inspection.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I will give you an overview of the property's condition and point out any defects that are visible at that time. 
            The inspection does not cover everything and does not check for compliance with any building codes or regulations.
        </p>

        <h2 class="standards-of-practice-section-title">2. The Inspector's Responsibilities</h2>

        <h3 class="standards-of-practice-sub-section-title">2.1 Perform a Visual Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The inspector shall evaluate readily accessible and visible installed systems and components listed in these standards.
        </p>

        <h3 class="standards-of-practice-sub-section-title">2.2 Provide a Written Report</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The report will clearly document:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item">Systems and components that do not work properly or are significantly deficient, unsafe, or near the end of their service life.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Recommendations to correct, monitor, or further evaluate reported deficiencies.</li>
            <li class="list-item">The reasoning behind any deficiencies that are not self-evident.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Any systems designated for evaluation but not evaluated, along with the reason.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="standards-of-practice-sub-section-title">2.3 Maintain Professional Ethics</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The inspector will conduct the inspection with honesty, integrity, and objectivity, avoiding conflicts of interest.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The inspector may add services, list repairs if qualified, or omit systems at the client's request.

            <p class="paragraph">
                For clients who wish to review widely recognized home inspection standards, reputable organizations such as the 
                American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) publish detailed guidelines that outline the general scope of a 
                professional home inspection. These external standards are not part of this report and are provided solely for 
                informational purposes.
